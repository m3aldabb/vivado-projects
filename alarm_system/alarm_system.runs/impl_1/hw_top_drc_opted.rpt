2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT genblk1[0].debounce_0/clk_divider_0/q_i_1 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
genblk1[0].debounce_0/dff_0/q_reg, genblk1[0].debounce_0/dff_1/q_reg, genblk1[0].debounce_0/dff_2/q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT genblk1[1].debounce_0/clk_divider_0/q_i_1__0 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
genblk1[1].debounce_0/dff_0/q_reg, genblk1[1].debounce_0/dff_1/q_reg, genblk1[1].debounce_0/dff_2/q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT genblk1[2].debounce_0/clk_divider_0/q_i_1__1 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
genblk1[2].debounce_0/dff_0/q_reg, genblk1[2].debounce_0/dff_1/q_reg, genblk1[2].debounce_0/dff_2/q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT genblk1[3].debounce_0/clk_divider_0/q_i_1__2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
genblk1[3].debounce_0/dff_0/q_reg, genblk1[3].debounce_0/dff_1/q_reg, genblk1[3].debounce_0/dff_2/q_reg
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
