2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_rd/clk_divider_0/slow_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_rd/clk_divider_0/q_i_1__0/O, cell debounce_rd/clk_divider_0/q_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_rd/edge_detect_0/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[4]_i_2__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_rd/edge_detect_0/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[4]_i_2__0/O, cell debounce_rd/edge_detect_0/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[4]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_wr/clk_divider_0/slow_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_wr/clk_divider_0/q_i_1/O, cell debounce_wr/clk_divider_0/q_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_wr/edge_detect_0/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[4]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_wr/edge_detect_0/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell debounce_wr/edge_detect_0/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_rd/clk_divider_0/q_i_1__0 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
debounce_rd/dff_0/q_reg, debounce_rd/dff_1/q_reg, debounce_rd/dff_2/q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_wr/clk_divider_0/q_i_1 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
debounce_wr/dff_0/q_reg, debounce_wr/dff_1/q_reg, debounce_wr/dff_2/q_reg
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
